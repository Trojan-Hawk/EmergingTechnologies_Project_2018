# Emerging Technologies Project 2018 

I am a student currently in my 4th year of study in GMIT's BSc Software Development course. This project was created as part of our Emerging Technologies module, lectured by Dr.Ian Mcloughlin.

This repository will be broken up into five separate parts:

*Part 1:*	A Jupyter Notebook covering, in detail, the numpy.random package.

*Part 2:*	A Jupyter Notebook covering the 'Iris' dataset with examples in python.

*Part 3:*	A Jupyter Notebook covering the 'MNIST' dataset with examples in python.

*Part 4:*	A Python Script file containing a digit classification algorithm. This script will determine,  within a certain degree, what type of digit has been drawn/supplied.

*Part 5:*	A Jupyter Notebook covering the script file in *Part 4*, detailing the various design decisions made and the overall functionality of the script.
