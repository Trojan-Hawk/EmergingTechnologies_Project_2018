# Emerging Technologies Project 2018 

### Introduction

I am a student currently in my 4th year of study in GMIT's BSc Software Development course. This project was created as part of our Emerging Technologies module, lectured by Dr.Ian Mcloughlin.

### Content

This repository will be broken up into five separate parts:

*Part 1:*	A Jupyter Notebook covering, in detail, the numpy.random package.

*Part 2:*	A Jupyter Notebook covering the 'Iris' dataset including the diï¬ƒculty in writing an algorithm to separate the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset. 

*Part 3:*	A Jupyter Notebook covering the 'MNIST' dataset with examples in python.

*Part 4:*	A Python Script file containing a digit classification algorithm. This script will determine,  within a certain degree, what type of digit has been drawn/supplied.

*Part 5:*	A Jupyter Notebook covering the script file in *Part 4*, detailing the various design decisions made and the overall functionality of the script.

### Execution Directions 

To run the Jupyter notebooks it is required to have previously downloaded and installed a scientific distribution of python. The most common and the one that I have used is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Jupyter Notebook is automatically installed when this distribution is installed.

The terminal will be used to run all of the commands below, if you do not know how to access the terminal click on the appropiate link, [Windows](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/7-ways-launch-command-prompt-windows-7-windows-8), [Mac OS X](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Mac), [Ubuntu](https://www.lifewire.com/ways-to-open-a-terminal-console-window-using-ubuntu-4075024). 

    Part 1:
Download the "numpy-random.ipynb" file from this repository, this is a jupyter notebook file. To run this Jupyter Notebook navigate to the directory it is located in using a terminal. Next type the following command followed by return: '*jupyter notebook*'
This will open up a jupyter notebook session in your default browser. You will need to select the "numpy-random.ipynb" file from the browser, this will open a new tab in browser where the notebook can be run and/or edited.

    Part 2:
Download the "iris-dataset.ipynb" file from this repository, this is a jupyter notebook file. To run this Jupyter Notebook navigate to the directory it is located in using a terminal. Next type the following command followed by return: '*jupyter notebook*'
This will open up a jupyter notebook session in your default browser. You will need to select the "iris-dataset.ipynb" file from the browser, this will open a new tab in browser where the notebook can be run and/or edited.

    Part 3:
Download the "mnist-dataset.ipyn" file from this repository, this is a jupyter notebook file. To run this Jupyter Notebook navigate to the directory it is located in using a terminal. Next type the following command followed by return: '*jupyter notebook*'
This will open up a jupyter notebook session in your default browser. You will need to select the "mnist-dataset.ipyn" file from the browser, this will open a new tab in browser where the notebook can be run and/or edited.

    Part 4:
Download the "digitrec.py" file from this repository, this is a python script file. To run this script navigate to the directory it is located in using a terminal. Next type the following command followed by return: '*python.exe digitrec.py*'
This will run the script file in the terminal.

    Part 5:
Download the "digit-recognition.ipyn" file from this repository, this is a jupyter notebook file. To run this Jupyter Notebook navigate to the directory it is located in using a terminal. Next type the following command followed by return: '*jupyter notebook*'
This will open up a jupyter notebook session in your default browser. You will need to select the "digit-recognition.ipyn" file from the browser, this will open a new tab in browser where the notebook can be run and/or edited.

### Additional Files and Directories

In this repositoy I have included a 'Test_Images' directory which contains images that are not contained in the MNIST dataset, these are here strictly for testing purposes. I have also included a 'ResultImages' directory, this contains screen captures of the various console output metrics used in the digit-recognition notebook. The pre-compiled weights files(.h5) have also been included, these may be used in the 'digitrec.py' script by simply renaming them to 'weights.h5'.

The images in both the 'Test_Images' and 'ResultImages' directories are my own work, they may be used by anyone.
